# ESP32-Smart-Seismograph-with-Emergency-Alert-System

The ESP32 Smart Seismograph is an IoT-based earthquake monitoring system that detects ground vibrations using an MPU6050 accelerometer and displays real-time seismic data on a 1.3-inch OLED (SH1106) display.

When vibration intensity crosses predefined thresholds, the system automatically triggers emergency alerts:

1. SMS alerts for moderate seismic activity (1st & 2nd events)

2.Automatic phone call for high-risk activity (3rd event)
